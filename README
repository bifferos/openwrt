This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution, hacked
to work better on the Bifferboard.

If you're unsure where to start try the following:

$ cp bifferboard_example_config .config
$ make package/symlinks
$ make

After some time you'll find your firmware in bin/rdc/openwrt-rdc-jffs2-64k-bifferboard.img

There is another firmware for 128k sector devices, please ignore that.  
You can play with the squashfs firmware if you know what you're doing.

Run 'make menuconfig' prior to running make if you want to select 
your own packages for inclusion into the firmware.  You can do that
at any time and then re-run 'make'.  The build system will only rebuild
the bits it needs to.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, patch, bzip2, flex,
make, gettext, pkg-config, unzip, libz-dev and libc headers.

A full install of Slackware 13.1 seems to do fine for me.

When the firmware is built, you can flash it to the device over the ethernet
with:
./tools/bifferboard/bb_eth_upload8.py eth0 00:01:02:03:04:05

Where 00:01:02:03:04:05 is the MAC address of your board (see the label).
You can leave off the firmware name, the script defaults to finding the
jffs image above unless you specify something else.

Any questions about this firmware please ask on the forum:

Cheers!
Biff.
